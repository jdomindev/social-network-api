# Social Network API
## Description
- The objective of this application was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
- The tools used to accomplish this were Express.js for routing, MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
- This project gave me a better grasp of how to use the Mongoose ODM and gave me more practice with back-end server routing.
- It also helped me to understand how Mongoose works with collections and how it makes relationships between documents using schemas and models.
